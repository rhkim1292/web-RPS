RPS on a web browser

## Plan
- Does my program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?

:This program will only be using the browser's console and prompts as an interface as of now. 
The prompts will allow the user to input their choice between rock, paper, or scissors. The console 
will print the results of the match.

- What inputs will my program have? Will the user enter data or will I get input from somewhere else?

:The user will enter data into a prompt.

- What's the desired output?

:The results of whether the user won depending on the user's input and the random choice the computer 
will make.

- Given my inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
:1. Define rules to determine a winner.
:2. Compare the user input data with the computer's random choice and see reference the rules we defined in the first step to determine who the winner is.
:3. Print the winner in the console.
